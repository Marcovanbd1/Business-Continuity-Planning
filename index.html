        <h2>What we usually mean by business continuity</h2>
        <p>
          When we say “business continuity” in health and care, we usually picture sensible, necessary actions inside organisations.
          Phone diversion, paper appointment sheets, staff working from home, relocation to another site, laptops, generators, and contact trees.
        </p>

        <p>
          These plans matter. They reduce harm. They keep services moving.
          But they are designed for <strong>organisational disruption</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          They quietly assume that the neighbourhood itself is still functioning.
          That people can travel, phones still work, pharmacies are open, digital routes still exist, and the world around the service remains navigable.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          This scroll-site is not arguing against continuity planning, it is widening the frame.
          Prolonged disruption creates a second problem, outside the organisation.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="missing-question" class="card">
      <div class="inner">
        <h2>The missing question</h2>
        <p>
          There is one continuity question that organisational plans rarely fully answer.
          Because it does not belong to any one organisation.
          It belongs to the neighbourhood.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>If disruption lasts a week or more, where do the people most at risk actually end up?</strong></p>
        <div class="attribution">Not who do they ring. Not which website they use. Where do they go.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="inner">
        <p>
          In prolonged disruption, continuity stops being a workflow problem.
          It becomes a geography problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          People do not move through digital pathways.
          They move through streets, buildings, rumours, visible lights, and word of mouth.
        </p>

        <div class="callout danger">
          If the only way to reach help is a phone line, an app, or a car journey, then continuity fails the moment those assumptions fail.

        <h2>When systems go dark for days</h2>
        <p>
          This is no longer hypothetical.
          Across recent decades, prolonged disruption has followed the same shape again and again.
          Different causes, the same neighbourhood failure pattern.
        </p>

        <ul class="list" aria-label="Common failure pattern">
          <li><span class="tick warn"></span><div>Power loss.</div></li>

          <li><span class="tick warn"></span><div>Home medical equipment failure.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Health systems still technically exist.
          But the neighbourhood continuity layer collapses first.

        <h2>What actually happens when neighbourhood continuity collapses</h2>
        <p>
          The examples below are not included for drama.
          They are included because the pattern is consistent.
          When digital and physical infrastructure degrade together, demand does not disappear.
          It changes shape and moves into physical space.

            <p><strong>What triggered it</strong><br> A winter storm knocked out large parts of the power grid.</p>
            <p><strong>What failed next</strong><br> Mobile networks degraded. Water treatment lost power. Fuel pumps stopped working. Pharmacies closed. Home oxygen and dialysis access became unstable.</p>
            <p><strong>What changed in the neighbourhood</strong><br> People began walking to visible buildings with generators. Emergency departments were used for warmth, charging, and reassurance. Churches and schools became informal routing points. Paper lists appeared on walls showing where water, insulin, and heating were available.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuity truth</strong><br> Digital systems technically still existed. Neighbourhood navigation had collapsed.</p>

            <p><strong>What replaced digital continuity</strong><br> Churches and community halls became physical routing hubs. Notice boards replaced websites. Known volunteers became informal safeguarding eyes. “If you need X, go to Y” travelled by word of mouth.</p>

        <h2>Why this matters for Weymouth and Portland</h2>
        <p>
          Modern disruption is not rare.
          Heat, storms, cyber incidents, supply chain shocks and fuel constraints produce the same stress pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our continuity plans already cover many internal scenarios well.
          What they do not yet fully provide is a way to keep <strong>care visible, navigable, and reassuring at neighbourhood level</strong> when digital assumptions fail.

        <div class="callout danger">
          When visible continuity collapses, the system creates a vacuum.

        <h2>What this reframing implies</h2>
        <p>
          Continuity is not just about keeping systems running.
          It is about where people end up, who they see, whether help still feels present,
          whether safeguarding remains coherent, and whether navigation remains calm and human.
